Based off of WorldWar1

* First person shooter game
* Rated M for Violence(although its really not all that bad) ,Weapons(each has its own little history session like the smallest gun ever(does absolutely no damage) created by a watch maker.) ,Blood this will appear often due to it being a First person shooter game. 
* If you get shot. Get a medic we cant have you dying now. **YOU HAVE A WAR TO FIGHT!**
